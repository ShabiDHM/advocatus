# PHOENIX PROTOCOL - THE DEFINITIVE AND FINAL CORRECTION (ROUTING INTEGRITY)
# CORRECTION: The two conflicting 'reverse_proxy' directives have been replaced
# with a single 'route' block. This guarantees that WebSocket requests are matched
# first and have the correct 'Upgrade' headers applied, while all other requests
# are passed to the second, general-purpose proxy. This resolves the routing
# conflict and ensures WebSocket connections can be established.
